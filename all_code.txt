print("Enter a to do:")  this is a function called print which will printout, in this case, a string.
a string is line of characters you must use "" or '' around your characters - be consistant
# we need to prompt user but also get some input
input() #this will get input from user but we need to save this input
user_text = input() #we assign a variable named user_text to input() = is assignment not equal to

print("Enter a to do:")
user_text = input()
print(user_text)

print() is a function
input() is a function
arguments go inside ()

"Enter a to do" is an argument used in the print() function

If use an argument in the input function we can remove the print line of code as the input() function is
also able to print to screen so or code will look like:

user_text = input("Enter a to do:")
print(user_text)

it is possible to store a string as a variable so we could store "Enter a to do: " as a variable by

user_prompt = "Enter a to do: " and then using this variable as an argument in function input()
input(prompt)
we can also assign this function to a variable
user_text = input(user_prompt)
print(user_text)
