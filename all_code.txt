print("Enter a to do:")  this is a function called print which will printout, in this case, a string.
to use a function we use it's name and then brackets () and in the brackets we enter the values
a string is line of characters you must use "" or '' around your characters - be consistent
# we need to prompt user but also get some input
input() #this will get input from user but we need to save this input
user_text = input() #we assign a variable named user_text to input() = is assignment not equal to

print("Enter a to do:")
user_text = input()
print(user_text)

print() is a function
input() is a function
arguments go inside ()

"Enter a to do" is an argument used in the print() function

If use an argument in the input function we can remove the print line of code as the input() function is
also able to print to screen so or code will look like:

user_text = input("Enter a to do:")
print(user_text)

it is possible to store a string as a variable so we could store "Enter a to do: " as a variable by
by giving it a name in this case user_prompt and assigning using = and the value "Enter a to do:" which is a string type

user_prompt = "Enter a to do: " and then using this variable as an argument in function input()
input(prompt)
we can also assign this function to a variable
user_text = input(user_prompt)
print(user_text)

entering multiple to do lines
one way multiple input functions
user_text = input(user_prompt) is changed to
user_text1 = input(user_prompt)
user_text2 = input(user_prompt)
user_text3 = input(user_prompt) etc

we now need a way to store multiple variables
in this case we can use lists which is a data type
list are show by using the square brackets []

create another variable called to_do and add the user text separating each with a comer , - using the assignment operator

to_do = [user_text1, user_text2, user_text3]
the above is another variable with data type of list
and then print out using
print(to_do)
this will print out the list

to find out what data type a variable is we use another function called 'type'

print(type(to_do))

above we have a function 'type' inside another function 'print' and the name of the variable to_do
in this case it will print out class as 'list'
if changed to user_text3 we would get class 'str' for string

the above method of getting user input is not sustainable as we do not know how many to do items the user may wish to enter
at any give time, 1 or 200, it is unfeasible to have 200 input functions!

so far the code looks like:
user_prompt = "Enter a to do: "
user_text1 = input(user_prompt)
user_text2 = input(user_prompt)
user_text3 = input(user_prompt)

to_do = [user_text1, user_text2, user_text3]
print(to_do)

print(type(to_do))  # this prints out the data type of the variable to_do, can change it to user_prompt or user_text

now we move to 'Batch' operations:
in the above asking user three times for an input - what if they had more or less items to include in their list?
We want to have one input function and then execute this function multiple times

one way is to use a while loop
